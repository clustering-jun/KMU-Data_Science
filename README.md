### Course Objectives
Learn the concepts of data science and study methodologies for handling various types of data. Define specific data analysis problems such as regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, network analysis, and natural language processing, and learn and practice methods to solve each problem. While studying these methodologies, acquire fundamental mathematics related to data science. Through hands-on exercises, practice collecting, exploring, cleaning, processing, and manipulating data, while also gaining proficiency in programming for data science. Having prior knowledge of basic Python programming, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and machine learning fundamentals will greatly help in understanding this course.
