### Course Objectives
In this course, you will learn the fundamental concepts and practical applications of data science, focusing on both supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Through lectures and hands-on exercises, you will explore key algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and clustering methods like K-means. As the course progresses, you will delve into advanced topics including dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), network analysis with PageRank, and probabilistic models like Naive Bayes and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

By learning how to analyze, visualize, and model data effectively, you will develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets. This course aims to equip you with the foundational knowledge and technical skills needed to pursue further study or a career in data science, while fostering an understanding of how data-driven approaches can be applied in real-world contexts.
